# GoF Design Patterns – Problem Driven (TypeScript)

This repository is a **design training project**, not a pattern reference.

The goal is to internalize GoF design patterns by following this process:

1. Write a naïve but realistic TypeScript implementation
2. Feel the pain when requirements change
3. Identify why the structure resists change
4. Incrementally refactor the design
5. Only then, name the design pattern

## Pattern names are intentionally hidden until the final step.

This project is optimized for:

- Experienced engineers
- TypeScript users
- Cursor-based, prompt-driven learning

If you are looking for quick answers or pattern summaries, this is not the right place.
